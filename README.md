Quick and dirty "morpion" game that works over the network. Network behaviour is fully implemented,
local behaviour not anymore (ie. play on the exact same Java instance).

Needs serious UI improvements, but well, close enough!

### Usage

First, run two clients using `java -jar Morpion.jar &`, then run the server using `java -jar server.jar`, then connect the two clients. Make sure clients' working directory contains the images used by the game.
